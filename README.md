# How to run

- First, set the parameters in run_benchmarks.sh
- Then, run run_benchmarks.sh while the Postgres server is running.
- Re-running may require dropping and re-creating the database.

The scripts are taken from [EnterpriseDB/benchmarking-postgres](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/benchmarking-postgres/tree/master) (many thanks to them!) and slightly edited.
