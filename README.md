# How to run

- First, set the parameters in run_benchmarks.sh
- Then, run run_benchmarks.sh while the Postgres server is created but not running.

The scripts are taken from [EnterpriseDB/benchmarking-postgres](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/benchmarking-postgres/tree/master) (many thanks to them!) and slightly edited.
